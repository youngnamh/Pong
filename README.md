## Overview

    This is a Pong game built using Unity with a twist. It's in space!

    can defeat the machines!

## Bugs

- Occasionally, the sound of the speedBoost appears (Issue #1)
- There is an issue with clones of scripts not being destroyed after execution (Issue #2)
- The ball will occasionally get too fast and out of control (Issue #3)
- at certain angles, the ball will bounce back and forth too much, if the ball hits something at 90 degrees it should be rebound skewed to prevent it getting stuck.
